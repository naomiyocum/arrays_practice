## How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
* I feel pretty confident with the content so far. I will still need to refer to my notes for the different methods of adding/returning to the beginning/end of arrays. However, I will continue practicing so `.pop`, `.push`, `.shift`, `.unshift` will be memorized soon.

## Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
Not that I can think of.

## What questions do you have about Arrays?
Is it common to use the `.shift` and `.pop` methods in everyday work? What if I want to remove elements in an array containing thousands of elements and am not sure where the specific elements are placed?
